//		 It represents a function which does not take in any argument but produces a value of type T
//		T: denotes the type of the result
//		The lambda expression assigned to an object of Supplier type is used to define

//		The Supplier functional interface is also a type of functional interface that does not take
//		any input or argument and yet returns a single output. This type of functional interface is 
//		generally used in the lazy generation of values. Supplier functional interfaces are also 
//		used for defining the logic for the generation of any sequence. For example â€“ The logic 
//		behind the Fibonacci Series can be generated with the help of the Stream.generate method, 
//		which is implemented by the Supplier functional Interface.
